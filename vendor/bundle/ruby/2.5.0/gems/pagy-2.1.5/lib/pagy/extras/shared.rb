  # Default :breakpoints

  # Helper for building the page_nav with javascript. For example:
  # with an object like:
  #   Pagy.new count:1000, page: 20, breakpoints: {0 => [1,2,2,1], 350 => [2,3,3,2], 550 => [3,4,4,3]}
  # it returns something like:
  #   { :items  => [1, :gap, 18, 19, "20", 21, 22, 50, 2, 17, 23, 49, 3, 16, 24, 48],
  #     :series => { 0   => [1, :gap, 18, 19, "20", 21, 22, :gap, 50],
  #                  350 => [1, 2, :gap, 17, 18, 19, "20", 21, 22, 23, :gap, 49, 50],
  #                  550 => [1, 2, 3, :gap, 16, 17, 18, 19, "20", 21, 22, 23, 24, :gap, 48, 49, 50] },
  #     :widths => [550, 350, 0] }
  # where :items  is the unordered array union of all the page numbers for all sizes (passed to the PagyResponsive javascript function)
  #       :series is the hash of the series keyed by width (used by the *_responsive helpers to create the JSON string)
  #       :widths is the desc-ordered array of widths (passed to the PagyResponsive javascript function)
